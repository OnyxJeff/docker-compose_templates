Welcome to **docker-compose_templates** — the single source of truth for all my Docker stack templates, optimized for deployment via Portainer.

## Why?

Instead of hunting for random YAML files scattered across the internet, this repo bundles all my curated, tested, and version-controlled Portainer stacks in one place. Deploy anything from lightweight services to complex multi-container apps with a single click.
